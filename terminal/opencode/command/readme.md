description: "Generate or enhence README.md file for project"
agent: build
---
Analyze the entire repository — including code, documentation, commits, and configuration files — to generate a clear, professional `README.md` that explains what the project is, how it works, and most importantly **why it was created**: the problem it solves, the motivation behind its development, and who benefits from it. The README should include concise sections for Overview, Why This Project Exists, Features, Installation, Usage, Configuration, Contributing, and License, using accurate commands and details found in the repo. Write in a polished, human-friendly tone that’s informative, structured, and ready to publish on GitHub. Acknowledgments for the authors.
